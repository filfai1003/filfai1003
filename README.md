👋 Hi, I’m @filfai1003

💻 I love coding with Java, C, and Flutter, and I’m always excited to dive into new languages!

🎮 Into tech like VR, 3D Printing, AI, and data management algorithms.

🛠️ Tools I use: GitHub, IntelliJ, CLion, and of course... Linux
    🐧 Linux is user-friendly. It's just picky about who its friends are.

🌱 Currently learning more about AI algorithms and expanding my coding skills.

🤝 Open to collaborating on any cool AI, data science, or software dev projects!

📫 Feel free to contact me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filippo-faiella-876310329/)

🎯 After my bachelor’s, I’m aiming to join a company where I can code non-stop and keep pushing boundaries.
